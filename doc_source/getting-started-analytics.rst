Tracking App Usage Data with Amazon Mobile Analytics
====================================================

Add the following import statement:
::

	#import <AWSMobileAnalytics/AWSMobileAnalytics.h>

Integrating Amazon Mobile Analytics
-----------------------------------

The sections below explain how to integrate Mobile Analytics with your app.

Create an App in the Mobile Analytics Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the `Amazon Mobile Analytics console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobileanalytics/home>`_
and create an app. Note the :code:`appId` value, as you'll need it later.

.. note::

    To learn more about working in the console, see the
    `Amazon Mobile Analytics User Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobileanalytics/latest/ug/>`_.

Integrate the SDK into Your App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't already done so, `download the SDK for iOS <http://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/>`_,
unzip it, and include it in your application as described at :doc:`setup`. The
instructions direct you to import the headers for the services you'll be
using. For this example, you need one of the following imports:
::

	#import <AWSCore/AWSCore.h>

Initialize the Mobile Analytics Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize an instance of the :command:`AWSMobileAnalytics` class. In doing so, you'll
need to provide the :code:`appId` value that you generated in the Mobile Analytics console.
The :code:`appId` is used to group your data in the Mobile Analytics console.

::

    AWSMobileAnalytics *analytics = [AWSMobileAnalytics mobileAnalyticsForAppId:@"yourAppId" identityPoolId: @"cognitoId"];

where "yourAppId" is the :code:`appId` value from the Amazon Mobile Analytics console and
"cognitoId" is the Cognito identity pool ID.

Add Monetization Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK for iOS provides the :code:`AWSMobileAnalyticsAppleMonetizationEventBuilder` class, which helps you
build monetization events to track purchases from Appleâ€™s IAP Framework.

To learn more about adding monetization events, see the API reference guide
for `AWSMobileAnalyticsAppleMonetizationEventBuilder <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSiOSSDK/latest/Classes/AWSMobileAnalyticsAppleMonetizationEventBuilder.html>`_.

Record Custom Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To record custom events, we first need to get the event client from the AWSMobileAnalytics instance.

::

    id<AWSMobileAnalyticsEventClient> eventClient = analytics.eventClient;

For this example, let's say your app is a game, and you want to record an
event when a user completes a level. Create a "LevelComplete" event.

::

    id<AWSMobileAnalyticsEvent> levelEvent = [eventClient createEventWithEventType:@"LevelComplete"];

Note that custom events can't start with an underscore (_), or they'll be
filtered out.

Add attributes and metrics to the event in key-value pairs.

::

    [levelEvent addAttribute:@"Upper Dungeon" forKey:@"LevelName"];
    [levelEvent addAttribute:@"Moderately difficult" forKey:@"Difficulty"];
    [levelEvent addMetric:@1763 forKey:@"TimeToComplete"];

Record the event.

::

    [eventClient recordEvent:levelEvent];

Events are submitted automatically when the user goes into the background.
However, if you want to submit events manually, you can do so with the
:command:`submitEvents` method:

::

    [eventClient submitEvents];

If you don't call :command:`submitEvents`, events will automatically be
submitted at periodic intervals.

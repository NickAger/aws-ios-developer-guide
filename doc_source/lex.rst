Understand Natural Language and Trigger Business Workflows with Amazon Lex
########################################################################

What is Amazon Lex?
===================

|LEX| is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces into applications using voice and text.
With |LEX|, the same natural language understanding engine that powers Amazon Alexa is now available to any developer,
enabling you to build sophisticated, natural language chatbots into your new and existing applications.
|LEX| provides the deep functionality and flexibility of natural language understanding (NLU) and
automatic speech recognition (ASR) to enable you to build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike,
conversational interactions and create new categories of products.

|LEX| enables any developer to build conversational chatbots quickly. With |LEX|, no
expertise is necessary â€” you just specify the basic conversation flow in the |LEX| console to create a bot.
|LEX| manages the dialogue and dynamically adjusts the responses in the conversation. Using the console,
you can build, test, and publish your text or voice chatbot. You can then add the conversational interfaces
to bots on mobile devices, web applications, and chat platforms (for example, Facebook Messenger).

|LEX| provides pre-built integration with |LAMlong|, and you can integrate with many other services
on the AWS platform including |COGlong|, |AMHlong|, Amazon |CW|, and |DDBlong|. Integration
with |LAMlong| provides bots access to pre-built serverless enterprise connectors that link to data in SaaS
applications, such as Salesforce, HubSpot or Marketo.

Using the following resources, you can integrate |LEX| with your iOS app to add a flexible natural
language interface for voice and text chat. No deep knowledge of either AWS services or natural language computing is needed.

For information on |LEX| concepts and service configuration, see
`How it Works <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`_ in the |LEX-dg|..

For instructions on how to integrate |LEX| into your iOS application, see
:doc:`getting-started-understand-natural-language-lex`.

For end-to-end sample apps using |LEX|:

- See the |LEX| sample app in the `AWS Mobile SDK for iOS samples <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-ios-samples/>`_.

- Use the Conversational Bots feature in `AWS MobileHub <https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/>`_ to quickly configure and provision an |LEX| backend in the cloud. You can then download a working demonstration iOS app project and SDK and helper files that are customized to match your configuration choices.
